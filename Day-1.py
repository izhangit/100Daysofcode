# I will make sure to spend some time every day coding along, for a minimum of 20 minutes a day.
# I'll be using Replit, an  amazing online IDE so I can do this from from my phone whenever I happen to be. No excuses for not coding from the middle of a field!


# You can follow my progress at replit.com/@IzhanAbdullah"""
